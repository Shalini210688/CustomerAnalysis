# CustomerAnalysis
Customer Analysis
In this project, I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a company's database. 
Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. 
Customers are segmented to optimize the significance of each customer to the business, to modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers.
It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.

The steps followed are:
Data Exploration
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Encoding and Feature Scaling
Dimensionality Reduction
Clustering
Profiling
